### Solo Project

## Overview

Miner Finder was created to give access to useful information about the Helium Blockchain as well as provide users with the ability to check Miner details, status, and rewards. Miner Finder gives users the ability to monitor Helium's oracle price on a live and responsive 1 day chart. Browsing through the stats container users will find a wide range of stats like total hotspots and Number of Cities mining. If a user is curious about the status or rewards of their miner or a friends' miner they can quickly search for them with our miner search tool. After entering a valid miner name users are redirected to a miner summary page. Here users will be able to find the location, operating status, reward scale, as well as their rewards over different periods. Please enjoy.
